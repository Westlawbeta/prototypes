                  Employment discrimination claims in New York are primarily

                  NYSHRL prohibits discrimination in employment based on

                  To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the
                  NYSHRL, a plaintiff must demonstrate:

                  <li>
                    An adverse employment action (such as failure to hire)

                  Same protected class defense in failure to hire cases not an

                </h3>
                <p>
                  The central question is whether a plaintiff can maintain a
                  failure to hire discrimination claim when the employer
                  ultimately hires someone of the same protected class. Based on
                  New York case law, the fact that an employer hired someone of
                  the same protected class as the plaintiff is not an absolute
                  defense to a discrimination claim

                </p>
                <p>
                  While not an absolute defense, courts do consider the hiring
                  of someone from the same protected class as evidence weighing
                  against an inference of discrimination
                  <a
                    href="#"

                    >[2-c]</a
                  >. In
                  <a href="#">Ruderman v. New York State Insurance Fund</a>, the
                  court noted that the fact that NYSIF "ultimately selected
                  candidates from a broad age range, including at least one
                  candidate who was the same age as plaintiff" was a factor that
                  "weigh[ed] against any inference of discrimination"
                  <a
                    href="#"
                    class="link"

                    >[1-a]</a
                  >. Similarly, in <a href="#">Ayers v. Bloomberg, L.P.</a>, the
                  court dismissed a sex discrimination claim in part because
                  "the position ultimately went to a female employee"
                  <a
                    href="#"
                    class="link"

                    >[3-a]</a
                  >. The court found that this fact, along with others, meant

                  inference of discrimination based on sex.

                  Courts consider the hiring of someone from the same protected
                  class as one factor among many in determining whether
                  discrimination occurred

                    >[2-f]</a
                  >. As the court in <a href="#">Blackman</a> demonstrated, the
                  focus is on whether the employer's stated reasons for the
                  hiring decision were pretextual for discrimination, not simply
                  on the protected characteristics of the person who was hired

                <p>
                  Importantly, even if an employer hires someone of the same
                  race or gender as the plaintiff, a discrimination claim may
                  still proceed based on other protected characteristics

                  Plaintiffs alleging discrimination despite the hiring of
                  someone from the same protected class should focus on:

                <ol>
                  <li>

                    hiring decision
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Discriminatory comments or conduct during the hiring process
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Disparate treatment compared to similarly situated

                    Statistical evidence showing patterns of discrimination

                  Employers, on the other hand, should not rely solely on the
                  fact that they hired someone from the same protected class as
                  the plaintiff. They should ensure that their hiring decisions
                  are based on legitimate, non-discriminatory criteria and that
                  they maintain thorough documentation of the hiring process.

                      Fleming's discriminatory termination claim fails because
                      she cannot show the fourth element of her prima facie
                      caseâthat the circumstances surrounding her termination
                      give rise to an inference of discrimination. See Collins,
                      305 F.3d at 118. While a plaintiff may usually satisfy
                      this element by showing that she was replaced by someone
                      not in her protected class, see Zimmermann v. Assocs.
                      First Capital Corp., 251 F.3d 376, 381 (2d Cir.2001),
                      Fleming was replaced by another black female, Lisa
                      Derrick. Fleming argues that Derrick was hired to disguise
                      defendants' discriminatory act, but Fleming fails to point
                      to any admissible evidence to support this assertion.
                      Further, while Fleming points to cases concluding that
                      where a plaintiff is replaced with a member of her
                      protected class after the filing of a discrimination
                      charge might suggest a cover-up, see, e.g., Howard v.
                      Roadway Express, Inc., 726 F.2d 1529, 1534â35 (11th

                      959, 964 (5th Cir.1981), here Derrick was hired at the
                      same time that Fleming was fired, before Fleming took any
                      legal action against defendants.

                      It is "extremely difficult, if not practically impossible"
                      to establish discrimination where, as here, plaintiff was
                      passed over so an employer can hire another member of
                      plaintiff's same protected class. See Fleming v. MaxMara
                      USA, Inc., 644 F.Supp.2d 247, 261 (E.D.N.Y.2009).
                      Plaintiff is male, Lacayo is male, and the candidate
                      ultimately hired for the position, J.M., is male. Since
                      all three parties are male, it is highly unlikely that
                      gender-based animus motivated the decision not to hire
                      plaintiff.

                      As in Phillips, in which 75 to 80 percent of those hired
                      for the position at issue were women, see Phillips, 400
                      U.S. at 544, 91 S.Ct. 496, there is no serious question of
                      any general bias at NCA against hiring women, see Fisher
                      v. Vassar College, 70 F.3d 1420, 1433 (2d Cir.1995)
                      (âFisher I â), reh'g, 114 F.3d 1332 (2d Cir.1997) (en
                      banc) (âFisher II â), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1075, 118
                      S.Ct. 851, 139 L.Ed.2d 752 (1998), reh'g denied, 523 U.S.
                      1041, 118 S.Ct. 1341, 140 L.Ed.2d 501 (1998). In fact, it
                      is undisputed that NCA ultimately selected a woman, Selena
                      Thomas, for the promotion. In a âgender plusâ case,
                      however, the fact that the NCA hired someone of the same
                      gender as the plaintiff does not itself defeat an
                      otherwise legitimate inference of discrimination. See

                      As for her race and gender discrimination claims, Phillips
                      admits that the two offers made in connection with the
                      July 1999 opening went to African-American women.
                      Defendant argues that this fact alone prevents Phillips
                      from making out a prima facie case of discrimination.
                      (Def.Mem.Supp.Summ. J. 16.) Our Court of Appeals appears
                      to have disfavored this argument in Brown v. Henderson,
                      which stated that "discrimination against one employee
                      cannot be cured, or disproven, solely by favorable, or
                      equitable, treatment of other employees of the same race
                      or sex." 257 F.3d 246, 252 (2d Cir.2001). In support of
                      this proposition the Court of Appeals cited approvingly to
                      the Seventh Circuit case of Carson v. Bethlehem Steel
                      Corp., 82 F.3d 157, 158 (7th Cir. 1996), describing that
                      court as "rejecting the argument that plaintiff's
                      replacement by a worker of the same race precluded the
                      establishment of a prima facie case of race
                      discrimination.

                      Inc., 644 F. Supp. 2d 247, 261 (E.D.N.Y. 2009)). While
                      Defendantsâ promotion of C.L. (female) during the third
                      promotional cycle may weaken any inference of
                      discrimination, this is not a case where there is no other
                      evidence of discrimination. See Johnson v. N.Y.C. Dep't of
                      Educ., 39 F. Supp. 3d 314, 323 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (âWhere no

                      plaintiff is replaced with an individual within his
                      protected class undermines his attempt to establish a
                      prima facie case of discrimination.â (internal quotation
                      marks and alterations omitted)). Here, Plaintiff has
                      adduced evidence that during the three other promotional
                      cycles, Plaintiff was passed over and male police officers
                      were promoted instead.

                      Moreover, while also not dispositive, there is an
                      inference against discrimination where the individual
                      hired to replace a plaintiff alleging discrimination is
                      within the same protected class. See, e.g., Fleming v.

                      (Def. 56.1 Â¶ 107), a fact that further undercuts

                    Members of a protected class aren't identical. One member
                    can be treated in a discriminatory manner based on that
                    class, even if others aren't, as shown in cases like

                      For instance, an employee of a certain race with a strong
                      accent is denied a certain promotion, while another
                      employee of the same race - but without any accent - is
                      granted that promotion. Although both employees fall into
                      the same protected class, the employer's different
                      treatment of the two could still have been due to race.

                    <li>
                      Similarly, the ADEA protects employees over the age of 40.
                      But an employer could still deny a promotion to a
                      60-year-old based on age, even though they give the
                      promotion to a 40-year-old. Although both fall in the same
                      protected class, the employer's different treatment could
                      still have been due to age.

                      Whether unlawful discrimination occurred in these or other
                      situations therefore depends on the facts of each specific
                      case.

                      Hiring someone from the same protected class should not
                      automatically negate a discrimination claim. The fact of
                      hiring within the same class does not preclude the
                      existence of discriminatory intent if there is additional
                      supporting evidence.

                  is not dependent on an examination of who, if anyone, was
                  promoted instead of the plaintiff. Because Title VII was

                    the employer generally has more flexibility to terminate employment for any lawful reason, including social media activity, provided it does not violate public policy or statutory rights. Employers must evaluate whether the comment violates company policies or codes of conduct, such as those related to harassment, discrimination, confidentiality, or bringing the organization into disrepute. It's important to differentiate between comments made in a personal capacity and those that could be construed as representative of the company. Additionally, the impact of the comment on the workplace environment or company reputation should be carefully considered.
